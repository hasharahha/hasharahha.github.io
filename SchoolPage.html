        <p> I enjoy reading, anime, and playing games. I was actually quite interested in HTML, CSS, and JS a few years ago. My interest in it has died down over the years, but it still holds a special place in my heart (especially javascript :p).
          I started to become really interested in it, after I was making mods using block launchers api (you could basically make mcpe mods with javascript). It was really fun to work on things back then, and I met a lot of cool people... although don't talk 
          to them that much anymore. Either way, these languages have been my childhood (even though I don't think I was ever particulary good at them), it was still an amazing journey :). </p>
