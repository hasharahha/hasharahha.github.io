The spoon
Script writer: Jacob Bondley
Actors: Sebastian Mcconnell & Jack Acthl

During the afternoon, Sebastian was sitting quietly in the library while reading his book. 

Arlian enters the scene -> while immediately noticing that Arlian is reading his favorite book.

“How dare though, read my knowledge, my knowledge ALONE! Read thee!”

Sebastian reacts appropriately by saying

“I challenge thee to a spoon duel, accept though fate! Swallow though pride!”

Arlian flinching back, at a loss of words… Not expecting to be challenged to his specialty. 

With a snap of his fingers, his spoon flies towards him.

Arlian sending his arm down, with his spoon with an unyielding will to survive the battle

Ah… HA!

The spoon is blocked, and an amazing battle ensues. 

The cop enters the scene -> 

“DROP THOUGH WEAPON PEASANT!!!!”

Surprised by the sudden commandment, Arlian drops the spoon while mumbling to himself

*Arlian Drops the spoon*

“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?”

*The cop spoon-cuffs him*
